<h1 title=""><i>Nalakihu-Citadel Trail</i></h1>
<p>This booklet will guide you through Nalakihu (nah-LAH-kee-hoo),
the small excavated surface pueblo near the parking area, and the
Citadel, the large fortified, unexcavated structure on top of the butte.
The trail is short and will lead you around to the rear of the Citadel,
passing a large limestone sink, and to the top of the butte, where you
may obtain a magnificent view of the surrounding country and see
many other ruins from this vantage point. Numbered stakes on the
trail correspond to numbered paragraphs in this leaflet, which will
assist you in your understanding of this area and its early people.</p>
<p><i>We ask that you please keep off the ruin walls, and do not remove
any pottery fragments, rocks, plants or other material from the
area. Thank you.</i></p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c2">1</h3>
<p>This unexcavated, rectangular pithouse structure was of a
type used by some of the inhabitants of the area prior to A.D. 1125.</p>
<p>Surface masonry architecture was not adopted by this tribe (archeologists
call them the Sinagua&mdash;see-NAH-wah) until the early 1100s
at which time their neighbors to the north, a tribe which scientists
named the Anasazi (the Old People), introduced above-ground masonry
structures to this region.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="c3">2</h3>
<p>Nalakihu is a Hopi word meaning &ldquo;Lone House&rdquo; or &ldquo;House
Standing Alone.&rdquo; This pueblo had 10 rooms on the ground floor,
3 or 4 more rooms which formed a second story, providing a home
for about 25 to 30 people.</p>
<p>A charred roof beam of ponderosa pine, lying on the floor of the
first room, gave a tree-ring date of A.D. 1183, indicating that this
little pueblo was built in the late 1100s. Dates of 1192 and 1260
have been obtained on wood from the Citadel above which would
cause us to believe that both pueblos were built at approximately the
same time.</p>
<p>By observing how the walls of various rooms butt against each
other we can deduce that the rooms at the secondary doorway constitute
the oldest part of the pueblo, because these walls were erected
at one time and the other walls butt against them. When these three
rooms constituted the whole pueblo, it was probably a one-family
house.</p>

</div>
<p>The three rooms in front of Nalakihu had no firepits and apparently
were used for storage. The same applies to rooms 5 and 7. The
remaining rooms had firepits and other features indicating they were
dwelling rooms, such as ventilators to bring in fresh air at floor level,
deflectors to keep draft of incoming air off firepits, and in room 4,
loom holes to anchor the lower horizontal bar of a vertical loom.</p>

<p>(<i>Please enter inner room.</i>) Roofs in Nalakihu had a main
beam spanning the room&rsquo;s shorter axis, with the rafter poles crossing
it. Over these, narrow wooden shakes and sometimes stone slabs
supported another layer of reeds, branches, bark, or grass, and 3 or
4 inches (7.5 or 10 cm) of clay. Two collapsed roofs were found in
each of four rooms so we know a second story once existed over the
central portion of the pueblo.</p>
<p>Note the T-shaped doorway through which you passed and also
the occasional lines of black volcanic rock in the walls which probably
were not for decoration because some courses in the building
were covered with plaster.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="c5">4</h3>
<p>You are now standing on the upper of two terraces. Exactly
what they were used for we are not sure, but they may have been
&ldquo;kitchen gardens&rdquo; similar to those in use today in some of the Hopi
villages.</p>
<p>Below the terraces to the right of Nalakihu, archeologists discovered
an unusual group of 6 burials and 16 storage, roasting or
burial pits. Most of the pits were jar-shaped, some had vertical sides,
and there were two pit ovens with flues, sort of teapot-shaped, with
the spout actually being the flue. Three of the six burials were those
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
of infants in shallow pits, some lined with stone slabs. Only a bowl
or a few sherds (pieces of broken pottery) were placed with them
for grave offerings. These pits have been backfilled and are not
visible today.</p>

<p>The Sinagua buried their dead with the body extended full length
while the Anasazi buried them in a flexed position with the knees
drawn up toward the chest.</p>
<p>The people who used these pits may have attached religious significance
to owls, for only owl bones were found here. Winona Ruins
south of here along U. S. Highway 66 produced only hawk bones.</p>
<p class="tbcenter"><i>Please stay on the trail.</i></p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c6">5</h3>
<p>You are standing in a circular ring of volcanic rock outlining
a room. On the slopes of Citadel Butte are several similar round or
rectangular outlines, none of which have been excavated. There is
another just above you, and several below.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c7">6</h3>
<p>The structure above is a fortified pueblo built on a small
remnant butte of volcanic origin. Note the loop holes. Through the
higher of these openings defensive warriors could shoot with bow and
arrow. The lower ones at floor level were air vents.</p>
<p>The black rock around you is basalt, formed by the cooling of
molten lava. Its color is due to the presence of iron minerals.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c8">7</h3>
<p>The valley below was the farming area used by the early
inhabitants of not only the Citadel and Nalakihu, but of many other
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
villages, the ruins of which you may observe on the surrounding
mesas. How many can you count? There are at least eight visible.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="c9">8</h3>
<p>Note the way the walls of the Citadel follow the outline of
the volcanic cliff upon which the structure is built. Again the loop
holes are quite evident. The structure was probably two stories high
on this side, which exhibits the best example of the masonry at this
site.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<h3 class="inline" id="c10">9</h3>
<p>This limestone sink in the foreground was formed when the
roof of a cavern in the Kaibab Limestone collapsed, probably plugging
the outlet and allowing a pond to form. There is another sink
2 miles (3.2 km) to the south, and ruins are clustered around its
edge also. The thick Kaibab Limestone forms the greatest portion of
the walls of the sinkhole. It is stained by seepage from the overlying
red Moenkopi Sandstone, a thin layer of which can be seen at the
base of the black lava which forms the surface.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c11">10</h3>
<p>You are now entering the Citadel by an entrance utilized by
the Indians of yesteryear. Note the loop hole guarding this entrance.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="c12">11</h3>
<p>This ruin has never been excavated. It might tell a story of
peaceful farming people finding it necessary to defend themselves
from neighboring tribes. Around the depression in the middle there
is space for an estimated 30 rooms; the outlines of some can readily
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
be seen. Approximately 50-60 persons probably lived in this village.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Pottery from cremation burials, a mug, pitcher, and a ladle.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Most of the broken pottery found on the Citadel&rsquo;s slopes is of the
type made by the Anasazi, a prehistoric tribe which once lived to the
north of here. Nalakihu&rsquo;s pottery, however, was only one-third Anasazi,
the other two-thirds being of the Sinagua and Prescott tribes.
The latter lived to the south and west. Different people who were
drawn to this region by the good farmlands created by the cinder
cover that fell with the eruption of Sunset Crater in A.D. 1065, lived
together as neighbors in this region, thus accounting for the different
types of pottery in the ruins.</p>

<p>Almost all of the dwellings were occupied for only a short
period. When the winds finally duned up the black cinders and blew
them off into the arroyos and the springs dried up, the people had
to move to a more productive location to grow their crops. We believe
that the Anasazi moved north into the Tsegi Canyon country
while the Sinagua moved south into the Verde Valley and east to
Chavez Pass near Winslow by the middle 1200s.</p>
<p class="tbcenter"><i>Every litter bit hurts!</i></p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c14">13</h3>
<p>You can see why the early people utilized this vantage point
for the construction of a fortified pueblo. Today, we can thank them
for a magnificent view of the surrounding country. In the distance
can be seen the San Francisco Peaks, O&rsquo;Leary Peak, Sunset Crater,
Painted Desert, Gray Mountain, and numerous volcanic cones, remnants
of the San Francisco volcanic field, over 2 million years old.</p>
<p>The structures you see from this point represent only a few of the
more than 800 sites found within Wupatki National Monument. The
largest ruin in this area is Wupatki ruin, 9 miles (14.5 km) to the
southeast. Wupatki, which has been excavated, housed about 250
persons during its period of occupation. A visit to Wupatki is well
worth your while.</p>

<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">GENERAL INFORMATION</span></h2>
<p>Sunset Crater is the most recent volcano among the 400 in the
Flagstaff region, and is located 18 miles (29 km) south of here. It
is one of the few prehistoric volcanoes in the world that we can accurately
date (another being Mt. Mazama, where now is Crater Lake,
Oregon), and one of the few that had such a pronounced effect upon
people living in the area. When it erupted it covered almost 800
square miles (2080 sq km) including the Wupatki area, with fine
black volcanic ash. This eruption took place <i>before</i> the masonry
pueblos in this region were built.</p>
<p>When the eruption was over, a few individuals probably returned
to this area and found, to their surprise and pleasure, they were able
to mature crops in locations where they hadn&rsquo;t been able to farm
before. The thin layer of volcanic ash acted as a moisture-retaining
mulch; the people could plant their seeds in the underlying soil and
the cinder cover would hold enough moisture to insure them a good
harvest.</p>
<p>When this word spread around, it created a great land rush, the
only one we know of in the Southwest. Large numbers of Indians
from all over this part of the Southwest swarmed into the region of
the cinder fall to take advantage of the new farming land. The Hohokam
came from the south, the Mogollon from the southeast and
the Anasazi from the north.</p>
<p>The main concentration took place between A.D. 1100 and 1200,
and during that time the area between the San Francisco Mountains
and the Little Colorado River was inhabited by perhaps 8,000
Indians.</p>
<p>The abandonment of the area is as interesting as the occupation.
Tree-ring evidence indicates that from about A.D. 1215 to 1300
there was a long drought of varying intensity which culminated in the
great drought of 1276-1299. Winds accompanying the drought turned
the area into a dust bowl, moving away the moisture-retaining cover
of cinders that the people had depended upon for their farming. The
people left as farming acreage decreased.</p>
<p>The Anasazi element apparently moved north or east into the
Tsegi Canyon or Hopi country, while the Sinagua moved south into
the Verde Valley and east to the Chavez Pass region near Winslow.
By the mid-1200s Wupatki probably was completely abandoned.</p>

<p>This region is one of the most interesting archeological and scenic
localities in the United States. Sunset Crater National Monument is
18 miles (29 km) to the south of Wupatki National Monument, and
was the source of the black volcanic ash which had such profound
effect on the prehistoric farmers. Twenty-one miles (34 km) farther
to the south is Walnut Canyon National Monument, a beautiful canyon
and rim setting for hundreds of ruined homes of prehistoric Indians
who also were influenced by Sunset Crater&rsquo;s ash. Farther to the south,
in the Verde Valley (noted as Great Drought refuge areas) are Tuzigoot
and Montezuma Castle National Monuments (the latter including
Montezuma Well).</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
